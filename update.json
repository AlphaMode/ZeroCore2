Having said so, this is still a braking change from previous versions.\r\n- AbstractModBlockEntity : the DataUpdate event is now deprecated and will be replaced in a future version with a new update notification mechanism that do not need a full IEvent for every TileEntity even if notifications are not needed. Also, changes to the Event class in this release almost drop to zero it's memory usage when it has no subscribers\r\n- Removed some deprecated methods\r\n- General speed and memory optimizations in the whole codebase\r\n- Bumped version to 2.1.0\r\n- Updated Minecraft to version 1.16.5\r\n- Updated Forge to version 36.2.0"
